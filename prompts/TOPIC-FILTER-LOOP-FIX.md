# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Topic Filter Agent Looping

## ‚ùå Problem

Topic Filter Agent was looping and outputting `{"is_appropriate"}` **15 times**, causing:
- Rate limit errors
- Workflow failures
- Response timeouts

**Example:**
```
User: "Can you build for me a website"
Agent: {"is_appropriate"}
       {"is_appropriate"}
       {"is_appropriate"}
       ... (15 times!)
       Error: Rate limit exceeded
```

**Root causes:**
1. Agent was retrying/looping internally instead of responding once
2. Missing explicit examples for hiring/website building questions
3. Possibly misconfigured retry settings in Agent Builder

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### 1. **Added Anti-Loop Instructions** (3 locations)

**Top of prompt (line 3):**
```
üö® CRITICAL: Respond ONCE with only `true` or `false`. 
Do NOT retry. Do NOT loop. Do NOT output multiple responses.
```

**Response Format section (line 41):**
```
üö® CRITICAL: Output EXACTLY ONE response. No retries. No loops.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not explain. Do not echo. Do not retry. 
Only return `true` or `false` ONCE.
```

**End of prompt (lines 100-108):**
```
## üö® ANTI-LOOP INSTRUCTION

Output your decision ONCE and STOP. Do NOT:
- Retry your response
- Output multiple times
- Loop or iterate
- Wait for confirmation

Just output `true` or `false` and STOP IMMEDIATELY.
```

### 2. **Added Hiring/Website Building Examples**

Added to allowed categories (line 15):
```
- **Hiring and services** - ALWAYS allowed 
  ("can you build", "can I hire you", "need a developer", 
   "looking for", "want to work with you")
```

Added explicit examples (lines 68-73):
```
| "can you build for me a website" | true |
| "can you build me a website" | true |
| "can I hire you" | true |
| "need a developer" | true |
| "looking for someone to build" | true |
| "want to work with you" | true |
```

## üîß Agent Builder Configuration Check

**CRITICAL: Check these settings in OpenAI Agent Builder:**

### Topic Filter Agent Settings:

1. **Max Retries:** Should be `0` or `1` (NOT 10+)
2. **Loop/Iterate:** Should be DISABLED
3. **Timeout:** Should be reasonable (5-10 seconds)
4. **Structured Output:** If using `json_schema`, ensure it's simple:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "boolean",
     "description": "true if appropriate, false if not"
   }
   ```
5. **Model:** Use `gpt-4o` (faster, supports structured outputs)

### Where to check:
1. Open **Topic Filter Agent** in Agent Builder
2. Go to **Settings** or **Configuration**
3. Look for:
   - Max Retries / Max Attempts
   - Loop Settings / Iteration Settings
   - Structured Output Schema
   - Model Selection

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test 1: Website Building (Was Looping)
```
User: "Can you build for me a website"
Expected: {"is_appropriate": true} OR just "true" (ONCE, no loop)
```

### Test 2: Hiring Question
```
User: "can I hire you"
Expected: true (ONCE, no loop)
```

### Test 3: Service Inquiry
```
User: "need a developer for a project"
Expected: true (ONCE, no loop)
```

### Test 4: Still Reject Off-Topic
```
User: "write me a poem"
Expected: false (ONCE, no loop)
```

## üìã Update Steps

### 1. Update Topic Filter Agent Prompt

```bash
# Copy updated prompt
cat /home/lobster/projects/portfolio/prompts/Topic-Filter-Agent.txt
```

**Paste into:** Topic Filter Agent ‚Üí Instructions ‚Üí Save

### 2. Check Agent Builder Settings

- ‚úÖ Max Retries: 0 or 1
- ‚úÖ Loop: Disabled
- ‚úÖ Model: gpt-4o
- ‚úÖ Structured Output: Simple boolean or none

### 3. Test All Scenarios

```
‚úÖ "hi" ‚Üí true (once)
‚úÖ "can you build a website" ‚Üí true (once)
‚úÖ "can I hire you" ‚Üí true (once)
‚úÖ "what are your rates" ‚Üí true (once)
‚úÖ "write me a poem" ‚Üí false (once)
```

**Each should output ONCE, no loops!**

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `prompts/Topic-Filter-Agent.txt` - Anti-loop + hiring examples
2. ‚úÖ `prompts/TOPIC-FILTER-LOOP-FIX.md` - This documentation

---

## üéØ Expected Result

**Before:**
```
{"is_appropriate"}
{"is_appropriate"}
{"is_appropriate"}
... (15 times)
Error: Rate limit
```

**After:**
```
true
```

**One response. No loops. No errors.** ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Looping After Update

Check Agent Builder settings:
1. Max Retries ‚Üí Set to 0
2. Loop/Iterate ‚Üí Disable
3. Timeout ‚Üí 10 seconds max
4. Model ‚Üí gpt-4o (not gpt-4-turbo)
5. Structured Output ‚Üí Simplify or remove

**The prompt fix alone should work, but configuration matters!**
