# Fix Summary: Hallucination & Emoji Rendering

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Agent Using Placeholders Instead of Real Data

**Problem:**
```
I'm [Full Name], a [headline] based in [location]...
I'm currently [availability status]...
```

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added prominent "NO PLACEHOLDERS EVER" section at top of prompt
- ✅ Updated all example responses with ACTUAL data
- ✅ Added explicit instructions to query profile FIRST and use real values
- ✅ Added warnings at each example interaction

**Changes Made:**
1. **New Section Added** (lines 9-29):
   - Lists all forbidden placeholders
   - Shows correct format with real data
   - Instructions to query & cache profile immediately

2. **Updated Examples** (lines 377-451):
   - Greeting: "I'm Pius Khainja, a Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer"
   - After email: Uses actual location, years, skills, availability
   - React projects: Shows real project names
   - Internship: Shows Tech Kidz Africa with dates
   - Testimonials: Shows actual client names and companies

3. **Updated Templates** (lines 42-56):
   - Removed all placeholders from greeting templates
   - Hardcoded name and role

### 2. 🎨 Emoji Rendering in ChatKit UI

**Problem:**
Emojis displaying as monochrome/text instead of colorful native emojis

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added emoji font stack to `globals.css`
- ✅ Applied to ChatKit components specifically
- ✅ Added cross-browser compatibility

**Changes Made:**
Added to `app/globals.css` (lines 153-172):
```css
/* Force colored emoji rendering across all browsers */
body,
.chatkit,
[class*="chatkit"],
[data-chatkit],
p,
span,
div {
  font-family: var(--font-geist-sans), 
               "Apple Color Emoji", 
               "Segoe UI Emoji", 
               "Noto Color Emoji", 
               "Android Emoji", 
               "EmojiSymbols", 
               sans-serif;
}
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Update Agent in OpenAI Agent Builder

```bash
# Copy the updated prompt
cat /home/lobster/projects/portfolio/prompts/Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt
```

**Paste into:** Pius AI with Sanity MCP → Instructions → Save

### 2. Test Placeholder Fix

Start a new conversation:
```
User: "hi"
Expected: "Hi! Great to meet you! I'm Pius Khainja, a Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer."

User: "my email is test@example.com"
Expected: "Thanks! Got it. 😊

I'm Pius Khainja, a Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer based in Mombasa, KE (Remote). I've been working in tech for 7+ years, specializing in React, Node.js, TypeScript, AI/ML, and cloud platforms. I'm currently open to new opportunities and projects."
```

**NO placeholders like [location], [X], [key skills], etc.**

### 3. Test Emoji Rendering

**Before:** 🙂 might look like ☺ (black & white)
**After:** 🙂 should be colorful

Test emojis in responses:
- 😊 Thanks! Got it.
- 🙂 Before we dive in...
- 🚀 Check out my projects!

## 🚨 Remember

1. **Always query profile after email collection** - cache firstName, lastName, headline, location, yearsOfExperience, availability
2. **Use cached data in all responses** - don't use placeholders
3. **Emojis will now render natively** - colorful across all browsers

**Update the agent now and test!** 🎉
