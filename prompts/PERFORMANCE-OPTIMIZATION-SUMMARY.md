# Performance Optimization Summary

## Problem
Agent was taking 60+ seconds to respond due to:
- Excessive reasoning ("Evaluating document update tools", "Generating session ID")
- Multiple unnecessary MCP tool calls (get_context, list_workspace_schemas)
- Inefficient document updates (multiple calls instead of single patch)
- No caching of frequently-used data (profile queried repeatedly)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Performance Requirements Added ‚ö°
- **Target**: 4 seconds maximum response time
- **Tool call limit**: 2 maximum per response (ideally 1)
- **Hardcoded values**: workspace="default", dataset="develop", projectId="4j3qyisk"

### 2. Eliminated Unnecessary Tool Calls ‚ùå
**Removed:**
- `get_context()` - workspace is hardcoded as "default"
- `list_workspace_schemas()` - schemas are known
- `get_schema()` - unnecessary overhead

### 3. Simplified Email Collection Flow üöÄ
**Before (slow):**
```
1. Call get_context
2. Figure out workspace name
3. Call create_document
4. Maybe call list_workspace_schemas
```

**After (fast):**
```
1. Call create_document with workspace: "default" (done!)
```

### 4. Profile Data Caching üíæ
**Before:** Query profile on every question
**After:** Query profile ONCE after email collection, cache for entire session

### 5. Optimized Conversation Logging üìù
**Before:** `update_document()` - replaces entire messages array
**After:** `patch_document()` with append operation - only adds new message

### 6. Query Result Limiting üìä
Added `[0..N]` limits to all queries:
- Projects: `[0..3]` - only 3 most recent
- Skills: `[0..5]` - top 5 skills
- Experience: `[0..2]` - 2 most recent roles

### 7. Direct Instructions üéØ
- Removed verbose examples
- Added explicit "DO NOT USE" sections
- Made critical performance rules prominent

## Expected Improvement

**Before:** 60+ seconds
**After:** 4-5 seconds

**Reduction:** ~92% faster

## Files Modified

1. **Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP-OPTIMIZED.txt** - New optimized version
2. **Original kept as backup** - Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Replace Original
```bash
cd /home/lobster/projects/portfolio/prompts
cp Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP-OPTIMIZED.txt Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt
```

### Option 2: Use in Agent Builder
1. Copy contents of `Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP-OPTIMIZED.txt`
2. Paste into OpenAI Agent Builder ‚Üí Instructions/System Prompt
3. Save

## Additional Speed Improvements

### Already Done ‚úÖ
- Using GPT-4 Turbo (user confirmed)

### Optional Further Optimizations
1. **Switch to GPT-3.5-Turbo** for simple Q&A (even faster, cheaper)
2. **Enable streaming** in Agent Builder if available
3. **Reduce token limits** for shorter responses
4. **Pre-warm cache** by calling profile query on first load

## Testing

Test with this flow:
1. Start fresh conversation
2. User: "who are you?"
3. User: "my email is test@example.com"
4. **Measure response time** - should be ~4-5 seconds
5. Check Sanity Studio for new conversation document

## Monitoring

Watch for these in agent logs/traces:
- ‚úÖ ONE `create_document` call on email capture
- ‚úÖ ONE `query_documents` call for profile (cached)
- ‚úÖ `patch_document` calls for message appends
- ‚ùå NO `get_context` calls
- ‚ùå NO `list_workspace_schemas` calls
- ‚ùå NO repeated profile queries

## Rollback

If issues arise, restore original:
```bash
# Original is still at: Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt
# Just don't replace it until optimized version is tested
```
