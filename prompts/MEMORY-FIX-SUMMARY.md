# 🧠 Memory Fix: Agent Forgetting Email

## 🚨 The Problem

The agent was asking for email TWICE in the same conversation:

```
User: "my email is loloolo@gmail.com"
Agent: "Thanks! Got it. 😊 ..."
User: "what do you Do"
Agent: "I'd love to share! But first, could you share your email?" ❌
```

**Root Cause:** Agent was not checking its conversation context/memory before asking for email again.

---

## ✅ The Fix

Added **4 critical memory checks** to `Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt`:

### 1. **Memory Check Section (NEW)**
- Lines 58-78
- Instructs agent to CHECK context/memory BEFORE asking for email
- If email found in context → skip collection
- If not in context → check Sanity for recent conversations
- CRITICAL rule: "Never ask for email twice in the same conversation"

### 2. **New Example: "After Email Already Collected"**
- Lines 508-521
- Shows WRONG vs CORRECT response when email already collected
- Example: `"ok..what do you Do"` → Answer directly, DON'T re-ask for email

### 3. **Updated Critical Reminder #1**
- Line 567
- Changed from: "Do NOT answer ANY questions until email is collected"
- To: "Do NOT answer until email collected THE FIRST TIME. But if ALREADY collected, DO NOT ask again"

### 4. **New Critical Reminder #2**
- Line 568
- **"🧠 MEMORY CHECK"** - Before asking for email, CHECK YOUR CONTEXT/MEMORY

## 🔧 How to Apply

1. **Copy the updated prompt:**
```bash
cat /home/lobster/projects/portfolio/prompts/Pius-Ai-With-Sanity-MCP.txt
```

2. **In Agent Builder:**
   - Open your **Main Agent** (Pius AI)
   - Go to **Instructions** field
   - **DELETE old prompt**
   - **PASTE new prompt** (with memory checks)
   - **Save**

## 🧪 Test After Update

```
User: "Hi their"
Agent: "Hi! ... Before we dive in, could you share your email?" ✅

User: "my email is test@example.com"
Agent: "Thanks! Got it. 😊 ..." ✅

User: "what do you do"
Agent: "I'm a Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer! ..." ✅ (NO re-asking for email!)

User: "tell me about projects"
Agent: "I've built projects like..." ✅ (STILL no re-asking!)
```

**Expected behavior:** Email asked ONCE. All subsequent questions answered directly.
